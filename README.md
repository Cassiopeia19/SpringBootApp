# SpringBootApp
This Spring Boot App demonstrates the usage of controllers (i.e. 'about', 'welcome'), the call to a thymeleaf message, and how html templates and css can be incorporated within this maven project to have a full-fledged app.  **If you decide to run the app, you may view it at:  http://localhost:8080/welcome.**
